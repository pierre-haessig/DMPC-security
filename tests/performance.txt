Notes on performance
====================

Closed loop MPC simulation
--------------------------

for a 1D system, horizon nh=30 pts

%timeit ctrl.solve_u_opt()
    0.45 ms

closed loop simulation on n_sim=240 pts:

%timeit ctrl.closed_loop_sim(T0, n_sim, dyn, Ts_fcast, T_ext_fcast)
   143 ms

→ 0.60 ms per step

and for longer horizons:

→ 0.75 ms for nh=50
→ 1.66 ms for nh=100
